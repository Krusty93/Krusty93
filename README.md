### I'm a .NET developer! ⚡
... with a passion for software development especially building robust and testable programs, looking for efficiency, code reusability and following SOLID principles.
I always try to use my past work experience and my knowledge to bring new ideas to my team. I believe in continuously updating my knowledge on the latest technologies trying them out in personal projects. I love to study programming and technologies and improve my skills.

Currently based in UK but open to relocation.
